# Debug Delete Functionality Test

## Steps to Test the Delete Action Buttons

1. **Open your browser** and go to the admin products page: `http://localhost:3000/admin/products/enhanced`

2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click → Inspect)

3. **Go to Console tab**

4. **Look at the products table** - you should see three action buttons in the "ACTIONS" column:
   - 👁️ View (eye icon)
   - ✏️ Edit (pencil icon) 
   - 🗑️ Delete (trash icon)

5. **Try clicking each button** and check the console for these messages:
   - For ANY button: `🚀 ROW ACTION TRIGGERED:` should appear
   - For delete specifically: `📝 DELETE BUTTON CLICKED:` should appear

## If NO action buttons work:

The issue is with the `onRowAction` callback not being triggered. This could be:
- Missing `apiService` instance
- React component not re-rendering properly
- Event handler not bound correctly

## If View/Edit work but Delete doesn't:

The issue is specifically with the delete case in the switch statement.

## If you see Console Errors:

Look for errors like:
- `apiService is not defined`
- `Cannot read property of undefined`
- Network errors

## Quick Test Commands

Run these in the browser console while on the products page:

```javascript
// Test 1: Check if apiService exists
console.log('apiService exists:', typeof apiService !== 'undefined');

// Test 2: Check if products exist
console.log('products on page:', document.querySelectorAll('tbody tr').length);

// Test 3: Check if action buttons exist
console.log('action buttons:', document.querySelectorAll('[title="Delete"]').length);

// Test 4: Manually trigger a delete (replace with actual product ID)
// Find a product ID first:
console.log('First product buttons:', document.querySelector('[title="Delete"]'));
```

## Expected Debug Output

When you click the delete button, you should see:
1. ✅ `🚀 ROW ACTION TRIGGERED:` - Row action handler is called
2. ✅ `📝 DELETE BUTTON CLICKED:` - Delete case is reached  
3. ✅ `🔑 AUTH TOKEN FOUND:` or `⚠️ NO AUTH TOKEN FOUND` - Auth check
4. ✅ `🗑️ DELETE PRODUCT DEBUG:` - API call starts
5. ✅ `✅ DELETE PRODUCT SUCCESS:` - API call succeeds

If any step is missing, that's where the problem is!

## Common Fixes

### If no Row Actions trigger:
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Check if there are JavaScript errors in console

### If Auth Token is missing:
- Go to `/admin/login` and log in
- Check localStorage for 'token'

### If API calls fail:
- Check if backend server is running on port 5001
- Check network tab for API errors
