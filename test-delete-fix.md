# Product Delete Fix Test

## Issues Fixed

1. **API Base URL Configuration**: Changed `API_BASE_URL` from pointing directly to backend (`http://localhost:5001/api`) to Next.js API routes (`/api`)
2. **Authentication Headers**: Ensured authorization headers are properly forwarded through Next.js API routes
3. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages for better debugging
4. **Image Upload URLs**: Fixed image upload methods to use proper backend URL

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Base URL in `src/lib/api.ts`
- Changed `API_BASE_URL` to use Next.js routes (`/api`) instead of direct backend access
- This ensures requests go through the Next.js middleware which properly forwards auth headers

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in Admin Products Page
- Added specific error messages for 401 (unauthorized) and 403 (forbidden) responses
- Added success messages for successful delete operations
- Improved bulk action error handling

### 3. Fixed Image Upload URLs
- Maintained direct backend access for image uploads since they use FormData
- Used proper environment variable for backend URL

## Testing Steps

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test single product delete**:
   - Go to admin products page
   - Click delete button on any product
   - Verify proper authentication and success/error messages

4. **Test bulk delete**:
   - Select multiple products
   - Choose "Delete" from bulk actions
   - Verify proper handling and feedback

## Expected Results

- Delete operations should now work properly with authentication
- Clear error messages for unauthorized access
- Success messages for successful operations
- Proper forwarding of requests through Next.js API routes

## Backend Requirements

The backend delete endpoints require `admin` role authorization:
- Single delete: `DELETE /api/products/:id` - requires `admin` role
- Bulk delete: `DELETE /api/products/bulk` - requires `admin` role

Make sure you have a user with `admin` role in your test data.
